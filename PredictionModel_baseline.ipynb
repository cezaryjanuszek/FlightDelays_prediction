    "# [Swisscom challenge] Flight delays prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research question: *What is the influence of the different airlines/airports on the flight delays?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this challenge is to investigate US flight delays and cancellations data from 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "First some exploratory data analysis is done to try to find some insights from general statistics about the airlines, airports and average flight delays. Second, using this same data the goal consists in creating a flight delay prediction model by implementing a:\n",
    "1) baseline model \n",
    "2) complex model (Neural Network or other Deep Learning method)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second model should have better performance than the baseline due to its increased complexity, which will make it also more difficult to explain its predictions.Therefore, an interpretability framework will be added to the second model to allow explicability of the created predictions."

    "# III. Baseline predicton model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we build the baseline flight delay prediction model. As mentioned in the previous steps, our delays are defined only by the arrival delays of the flights. Moreover, the arrival delays are probably correlated with the departure delays as the already provide important information about the potential final delay of the flight. Therefore, we will check the correlation between these two delay measures and decide to drop the departure delay feature based on the outcome, to ensure that we do not provide to our model to much information about the predicted value (arrival delay).\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve our flight prediction problem, a **regression model** will be able to not only predict if a flight delay will occur but also to provide a prediction of the time of such a delay. \n",
    "The pipeline to build our baseline regression model is as follows:\n",
    "1. Data pre-processing for feature cleaning and extraction\n",
    "2. Train-test split\n",
    "3. Choosing the model and hyperparameters tuning\n",
