# FlightDelays_prediction

This project is structured as follows:
1. [Data processing notebook](Data_preprocessing.ipynb) contains all the required data cleaning and processing before doing some exploratory analysis and creating the prediction models
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis notebook](*Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb) allows to explore our flights dataset and investigate some inital relations between airlines/airports and flight delays
3. [Baseline prediction model notebook](PredictionModel_baseline.ipynb) is where the baseline flight delay prediction model is created and evaluated. This constitutes our benchmark for the neural network odel
4. [Complex prediction model notebook](PredictionModel_complex.ipynb) contains the implementation of an Attention-MLP which goal is to predict the fligh delays as well as provide some insights about its predictions
